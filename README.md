#Task 1
#I have created a program that calculates the factorial for any positive integer.
# The program takes an input from the user and then processes it through the if function and if the input is greater than 2 then the function goes through the loop infinite times until the input becomes 1 and hence the final output would be the factorial of the input.

#Task 2
# So in this task i imported the math module for the various functions as required by the task which are logarithm , sine.
# So importing the module just allowed me to use these functions just like the other simple functions.
